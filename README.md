# hand-wash-svelte

## Backstory
This is just some entry project for getting to know the semantic & rules of programing in Svelte. Based on (free code camp tutorial)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujbE0mzX-CU]

## About
This program uses very basci things in Svelte semantic. No for loops & if statements. Just pure contacting between components and primary school changes of the states. Hope that at least it will help you to wash your hands in proper way :wink: 

ps. The sound at the end is worse cringe than a 'dinner party'.
